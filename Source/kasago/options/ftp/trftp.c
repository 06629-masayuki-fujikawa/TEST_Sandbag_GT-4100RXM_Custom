/*
 * This module contains the FTP client implementation, and follows the FTP
 * protocol from RFC 959, and RFC 1123.
 *
 * Features of the FTP client implementation:
 * . Allows the user to operate in blocking or non blocking mode
 * . In blocking mode the FTP client will execute in its own thread. This
 *   is the preferred method on a multi-tasking system.
 *
 * . In non blocking mode each FTP client command will return immediately.
 *   If the command has not finished, then the return code will be
 *   TM_EWOULDBLOCK. When the command returns TM_EWOULDBLOCK, then
 *   the user should call tfFtpExecute() until the return value from
 *   tfFtpExecute() is no longer TM_EWOULDBLOCK, which
 *   indicates that the command has completed. The return value from
 *   tfFtpExecute() gives the status of the command: 0 for success,
 *   TM_EWOULDBLOCK if the command has not completed,
 *   any other value for failure. If the user were to call a
 *   new command before the current one has completed, then the
 *   command will not be executed or queued, and the return code
 *   will be TM_EACCES. The only exception is for an abort command
 *   tfFtpAbor(), a QUIT command tfFtpQuit(), or STAT with no argument
 *   tfFtpStat() command that will be sent right away.
 *
 * 1. First the user calls tfFtpNewSession() to open an FTP session.
 *    The user gets a pointer to a FTP session on success, null pointer
 *    otherwise. This pointer is to be used as first argument of all
 *    following FTP API calls.
 * 2. Next the user could call tfFtpTurnPort() locally to turn on/or
 *    off usage of PORT command during data transfer
 *    Since we set the default to on as recommended by RFC 1123, the
 *    user would probably never use tfFtpTurnPort().
 * 3. Next the user calls tfFtpConnect() to connect to an FTP server.
 * 4. Next the user calls tfFtpLogin() to login on the remote server
 *    (this executes USER, and possibly PASS, ACCT commands).
 * 5. Then the user can call any other FTP command:
 *
 *    CWD command:  tfFtpCwd()
 *    CDUP command: tfFtpCdup()
 *    SMNT command: tfFtpSmnt()
 *    REIN command: tfFtpRein()
 *    QUIT command: tfFtpQuit()
 *
 *    PORT command: tfFtpPort()
 *    TYPE command: tfFtpType()
 *    STRU command: tfFtpStru()
 *
 *    RETR command: tfFtpRetr()
 *    STOR command: tfFtpStor()
 *    STOU command: tfFtpStou()
 *    APPE command: tfFtpAppe()
 *    ALLO command: tfFtpAllo()
 *    RNFR command, and RNTO commands: tfFtpRename()
 *    ABOR command: tfFtpAbor()
 *    DELE command: tfFtpDele()
 *    RMD  command: tfFtpRmd()
 *    MKD  command: tfFtpMkd()
 *    PWD  command: tfFtpPwd()
 *    LIST, and NLST commands: tfFtpDirList()
 *    SITE command: tfFtpSite()
 *    SYST command: tfFtpSyst()
 *    STAT command: tfFtpStat()
 *    HELP command: tfFtpHelp()
 *    NOOP command: tfFtpNoop()
 *
 * 6. When done the user should call tfFtpQuit() to disconnect from
 *    the server.
 * 7. If tfFtpQuit() fails, then
 *    the user can call tfFtpClose() to close the control socket.
 * 8. The user could reuse the allocated FTP session to connect again,
 *    or if there is no longer any need for an FTP session can call
 *    tfFtpFreeSession() to free the session allocated in tfFtpNewSession().
 *
 * Internals of the design:
 * . In blocking mode all opened sockets are kept to their default blocking
 *   mode.
 * . In non blocking mode all opened sockets are set in non blocking mode,
 *   and call backs are registered for events that we would have waited for
 *   if we were blocking. When the user calls tfFtpExecute() we check
 *   for call back events that have occured.
 *
 * In each user FTP API command, the function tfFtpCheckSession() is called
 * to check that the session parameter is valid, that the command is
 * valid for the FTP state (connected, logged in), that the previous
 * command has completed. The only exceptions are for tfFtpTurnPort() since
 * it is executed locally, or for commands that
 * can be sent to the server while it is processing a data transfer command
 * (i.e STAT with no argument, QUIT, or ABORT), in which case the function
 * tfFtpCheckInterSession() is called instead. (tfFtpCheckInterSession() itself
 * calls tfFtpCheckSession(), but allows one extra command to be sent if
 * the current command is a data transfer command.)
 * Then the parameters are
 * checked, some copied to the FTP session if they need to be remembered
 * for later use. Then the common function tfFtpCommand() is called.
 * tfFtpCommand() will format the command, send it on the control connection,
 * and then if no error occurs, call
 * tfFtpRecvCtrl(). tfFtpRecvCtrl() will receive the data on the control
 * connection using a subset of the TELNET NVT transformation. Note
 * that in non blocking mode tfFtpRecvCtrl() will return with a
 * TM_EWOULBLOCK error, and will be called later in the tfFtpExecute()
 * thread if a CB recv has occured. When a complete reply has been
 * received, then the function tfFtpScanReply will be called from
 * tfFtpRecvCtrl().
 * Note that in most of the routines (when no extra paramter is used) a
 * common function tfFtpCheckCommand()
 * is called that calls both tfFtpCheckSession() and tfFtpCommand() and
 * check on a non null parameter if appropriate.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Description of the FTP protocol from RFC 959:
 *
 * server-FTP process
 * A process or set of processes which perform the function of
 * file transfer in cooperation with a user-FTP process and,
 * possibly, another server.  The functions consist of a protocol
 * interpreter (PI) and a data transfer process (DTP).
 *
 * server-PI
 * The server protocol interpreter "listens" on Port L for a
 * connection from a user-PI and establishes a control
 * communication connection.  It receives standard FTP commands
 * from the user-PI, sends replies, and governs the server-DTP.
 *
 * server-DTP
 * The data transfer process, in its normal "active" state,
 * establishes the data connection with the "listening" data port.
 * It sets up parameters for transfer and storage, and transfers
 * data on command from its PI.  The DTP can be placed in a
 * "passive" state to listen for, rather than initiate a
 *
 * user-FTP process
 * A set of functions including a protocol interpreter, a data
 * transfer process and a user interface which together perform
 * the function of file transfer in cooperation with one or more
 * server-FTP processes.  The user interface allows a local
 * language to be used in the command-reply dialogue with the
 * user.
 *
 * user-DTP
 * The data transfer process "listens" on the data port for a
 * connection from a server-FTP process.  If two servers are
 * transferring data between them, the user-DTP is inactive.
 *
 * user-PI
 * The user protocol interpreter initiates the control connection
 * from its port U to the server-FTP process, initiates FTP
 * commands, and governs the user-DTP if that process is part of
 * the file transfer.
 *

 *
 *                Server-FTP                   USER-FTP
 *
 *    NOTES: 1. The data connection may be used in either direction.
 *           2. The data connection need not exist all of the time.
 *
 *                    Figure 1  Model for FTP Use
 *
 *    In the model described in Figure 1, the user-protocol interpreter
 *    initiates the control connection.  The control connection follows
 *    the Telnet protocol.  At the initiation of the user, standard FTP
 *    commands are generated by the user-PI and transmitted to the
 *    server process via the control connection.  (The user may
 *    establish a direct control connection to the server-FTP, from a
 *    TAC terminal for example, and generate standard FTP commands
 *    independently, bypassing the user-FTP process.) Standard replies
 *    are sent from the server-PI to the user-PI over the control
 *    connection in response to the commands.
 *
 *    The FTP commands specify the parameters for the data connection
 *    (data port, transfer mode, representation type, and structure) and
 *    the nature of file system operation (store, retrieve, append,
 *    delete, etc.).  The user-DTP or its designate should "listen" on
 *    the specified data port, and the server initiate the data
 *    connection and data transfer in accordance with the specified
 *    parameters.  It should be noted that the data port need not be in
 *    the same host that initiates the FTP commands via the control
 *    connection, but the user or the user-FTP process must ensure a
 *    "listen" on the specified data port.  It ought to also be noted
 *    that the data connection may be used for simultaneous sending and
 *    receiving.
 *
 *    In another situation a user might wish to transfer files between
 *    two hosts, neither of which is a local host. The user sets up
 *    control connections to the two servers and then arranges for a
 *    data connection between them.  In this manner, control information
 *    is passed to the user-PI but data is transferred between the
 *    server data transfer processes.  Following is a model of this
 *    server-server interaction.
 *
 *
 *                  Control     ------------   Control
 *                  ---------->| User-FTP |<-----------
 *                  |          | User-PI  |           |
 *                  |          |   "C"    |           |
 *                  V          ------------           V
 *          --------------                        --------------
 *          | Server-FTP |   Data Connection      | Server-FTP |
 *          |    "A"     |<---------------------->|    "B"     |
 *          -------------- Port (A)      Port (B) --------------
 *
 *
 *                               Figure 2
 *
 *    The protocol requires that the control connections be open while
 *    data transfer is in progress.  It is the responsibility of the
 *    user to request the closing of the control connections when
 *    finished using the FTP service, while it is the server who takes
 *    the action.  The server may abort data transfer if the control
 *    connections are closed without command.
 *
 *    The Relationship between FTP and Telnet:
 *
 *       The FTP uses the Telnet protocol on the control connection.
 *       This can be achieved in two ways: first, the user-PI or the
 *       server-PI may implement the rules of the Telnet Protocol
 *       directly in their own procedures; or, second, the user-PI or
 *       the server-PI may make use of the existing Telnet module in the
 *       system.
 *
 *       Ease of implementaion, sharing code, and modular programming
 *       argue for the second approach.  Efficiency and independence
 *       argue for the first approach.  In practice, FTP relies on very
 *       little of the Telnet Protocol, so the first approach does not
 *       necessarily involve a large amount of code.

 *
 *  STATE DIAGRAMS
 *
 * Here we present state diagrams for a very simple minded FTP
 * implementation.  Only the first digit of the reply codes is used.
 * There is one state diagram for each group of FTP commands or command
 * sequences.
 *
 * The command groupings were determined by constructing a model for
 * each command then collecting together the commands with structurally
 * identical models.
 *
 * For each command or command sequence there are three possible
 * outcomes: success (S), failure (F), and error (E).  In the state
 * diagrams below we use the symbol B for "begin", and the symbol W for
 * "wait for reply".
 *
 * We first present the diagram that represents the largest group of FTP
 * commands:
 *
 *
 *                             1,3    +---+
 *                        ----------->| E |
 *                       |            +---+
 *                       |
 *    +---+    cmd    +---+    2      +---+
 *    | B |---------->| W |---------->| S |
 *    +---+           +---+           +---+
 *                       |
 *                       |     4,5    +---+
 *                        ----------->| F |
 *                                    +---+
 *
 *
 *    This diagram models the commands:
 *
 *       ABOR, ALLO, DELE, CWD, CDUP, SMNT, HELP, MODE, NOOP, PASV,
 *       QUIT, SITE, PORT, SYST, STAT, RMD, MKD, PWD, STRU, and TYPE.
 *
 * The other large group of commands is represented by a very similar
 * diagram:
 *
 *
 *                             3      +---+
 *                        ----------->| E |
 *                       |            +---+
 *                       |
 *    +---+    cmd    +---+    2      +---+
 *    | B |---------->| W |---------->| S |
 *    +---+       --->+---+           +---+
 *               |     | |
 *               |     | |     4,5    +---+
 *               |  1  |  ----------->| F |
 *                -----               +---+
 *
 *
 *    This diagram models the commands:
 *
 *       APPE, LIST, NLST, REIN, RETR, STOR, and STOU.
 *
 * Note that this second model could also be used to represent the first
 * group of commands, the only difference being that in the first group
 * the 100 series replies are unexpected and therefore treated as error,
 * while the second group expects (some may require) 100 series replies.
 * Remember that at most, one 100 series reply is allowed per command.
 *
 * The remaining diagrams model command sequences, perhaps the simplest
 * of these is the rename sequence:
 *
 *
 *    +---+   RNFR    +---+    1,2    +---+
 *    | B |---------->| W |---------->| E |
 *    +---+           +---+        -->+---+
 *                     | |        |
 *              3      | | 4,5    |
 *       --------------  ------   |
 *      |                      |  |   +---+
 *      |               ------------->| S |
 *      |              |   1,3 |  |   +---+
 *      |             2|  --------
 *      |              | |     |
 *      V              | |     |
 *    +---+   RNTO    +---+ 4,5 ----->+---+
 *    |   |---------->| W |---------->| F |
 *    +---+           +---+           +---+
 *
 *
 *  The next diagram is a simple model of the Restart command:
 *
 *
 *    +---+   REST    +---+    1,2    +---+
 *    | B |---------->| W |---------->| E |
 *    +---+           +---+        -->+---+
 *                     | |        |
 *              3      | | 4,5    |
 *       --------------  ------   |
 *      |                      |  |   +---+
 *      |               ------------->| S |
 *      |              |   3   |  |   +---+
 *      |             2|  --------
 *      |              | |     |
 *      V              | |     |
 *    +---+   cmd     +---+ 4,5 ----->+---+
 *    |   |---------->| W |---------->| F |
 *    +---+        -->+---+           +---+
 *                |      |
 *                |  1   |
 *                 ------
 *
 *
 *       Where "cmd" is APPE, STOR, or RETR.
